# Hi, This is RootSprout!

At RootSprout, we believe the best way to truly learn is to **start from the roots** â€” break things down to their fundamentals, and then **grow** them back up into fully working systems.  

## ðŸš€ Introduce Yourself

Introduce yourselves in the Discussion Guys!

Love to hear about new Ideas, projects, let your thoughts flow and bloom here:)

## ðŸš€ Projects  

**You can find the educational implementations of the systems. If you have one more feature, contribute to the following projects!**


- [**Kira-Kafka**](https://github.com/ROOT-SPROUT/Kira-Kafka)  
  A lightweight, educational distributed log system in C.  
  Mimics the core of **Apache Kafka** â€” topics, partitions, brokers, disk-backed logs, zero-copy reads, memory-mapped I/O, log compression, and thread-to-core mapping.  

- [**Ge-Git**](https://github.com/ROOT-SPROUT/Ge-Git)  
  **Git implementation in C**.  
  Supports blob, tree, and commit objects, replicating Gitâ€™s internal object storage system.

- [**Cow-Compiler**](https://github.com/ROOT-SPROUT/Cow-Compiler)  
  A **compiler** in C for a minimalistic language called **CowLang**.  
  Compiles CowLang into **LLVM IR**.  

- [**autoNormDB**](https://github.com/ROOT-SPROUT/AutoNormDB)  
  A **SQL database engine** built from scratch.  
  Focuses on **core database fundamentals** and learning how databases work internally.

- [**Exsh**](https://github.com/RootSprout/Exsh)  
  A **Unix-like** shell in C.  
  Implements command parsing, pipes, redirection, and process management using **fork()** and **execvp()**.
